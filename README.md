# DriveIn | The Google Drive 2.0

This project is made with React & Firebase, I try to "copy" Google Drive, but I found it design a bit to simplistic, so I use my styles to complete it.

This is my first React Project, 

It has simple tasks like 

  -> Firebase Google Authentication.

  -> Add a new image/file and add the Size of it to the variable and from that, makes the "Min-Max Storage".
  
  -> Light & Dark Mode instant
  
  -> File Viewer, open the file in a Popup like method.
  
  -> Delete/Download files/images.
  
  -> ToDo List, so that I can manage what I want to do next/ what its left to do.
  
  -> More Features comming soon.
